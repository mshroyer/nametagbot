# Nametag Bot

A Discord client that generates nametags for a server's members, using
their nicks/usernames and avatars. It:

- Downloads the server's roster using Discord's API.
- Templates a LaTeX document for printing physical nametags (not yet
  implemented).

This is not an officially supported Google product.
